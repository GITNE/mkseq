	<summary>A tool for preparing photo sequences for upload to Mapillary</summary>
	<description>
		<p>
			mkseq is a tool for basic preprocessing and optimization of
			sequences of photos on the command‑line and via scripts for upload
			to Mapillary. It has been developed with Mapillary users in mind
			who—for whatever reason—cannot or do not want to use a mobile phone
			camera and a respective Mapillary app to take photos for upload to
			Mapillary. Whatever the reason, photos which have not been shot
			with the Mapillary app may require or would benefit of some
			preprocessing or optimization prior to upload.
